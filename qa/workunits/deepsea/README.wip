The following section is WIP - do not use!
------------------------------------------

7. a file called 'deepsea-qa-cluster-layout' (working name) has optionally been
   created inside the same directory where the DeepSea repo was cloned. If it
   exists, this file is expected to contain data points describing the cluster
   layout (e.g. which nodes are storage nodes, which are client nodes, etc.).
   If it is not present, the test script will try to do without it.
