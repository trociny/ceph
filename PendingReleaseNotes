14.2.23
-------

* RGW: It is possible to specify ssl options and ciphers for beast frontend now.
  The default ssl options setting is "no_sslv2:no_sslv3:no_tlsv1:no_tlsv1_1".
  If you want to return back the old behavior add 'ssl_options=' (empty) to
  ``rgw frontends`` configuration.


14.2.19
-------

* OSD: the option ``osd_fast_shutdown_notify_mon`` has been introduced to allow
  the OSD to notify the monitor it is shutting down even if ``osd_fast_shutdown``
  is enabled. This helps with the monitor logs on larger clusters, that may get
  many 'osd.X reported immediately failed by osd.Y' messages, and confuse tools.

14.2.18
-------

* This release fixes issues loading the dashboard and volumes manager
  modules in some environments.
